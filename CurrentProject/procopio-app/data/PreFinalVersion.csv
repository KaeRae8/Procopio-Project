The Mission was only marginally successful in its attempts at converting the local Kumeyaay people. The Kumeyaay were so resistant to converting to Catholicism that not one conversion was recorded in the first year. This was in part because of food shortages at the mission^ the inability to provide the Natives with promised clothing^ the ability of the Kumeyaay to freely enter and exit the mission^ but mainly due to the Kumeyaay's spirit of independence. In 1775^ after strained relationships between Spanish soldiers^ missionaries^ and the Natives^ several hundred Kumeyaay launched an attack on the Mission^ destroying it by fire. The mission was rebuilt the following year in 1776. Initially^ Missions were established by Spanish missionaries because the Spanish misunderstood Native culture and ways of life as uncivilized and felt the only way to civilize them was to convert them to Catholicism.

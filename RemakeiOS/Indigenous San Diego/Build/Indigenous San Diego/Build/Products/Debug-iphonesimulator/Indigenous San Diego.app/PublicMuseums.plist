Protesters led by the Brown Berets, community activists, artists, M.E.Ch.A. and others took over the site and faced police and bulldozers for days while negotiations took place that resulted in the land being given over for a community park. By claiming Chicano Park, the descendants of the Aztecs the Chicano Mexicano people begin a project of historical reclamation. Located beneath the San Diego-Coronado Bridge in Barrio Logan, a predominantly Mexican American and Mexican-immigrant community in central San Diego, the park is home to the country's largest collection of outdoor murals, 72 in total. Murals that appear at Chicano Park feature the American Indian Movement (AIM), Yaqui dancers, and Aztec dancers to name a few.\Chicano Parkÿ	"#$%&'(_T-F 10-4; Sa 12-4X32.74294[-116.940651_www.cuyamaca.edu/museum_The Heritage of the Americas Museum is located on the campus of Cuyamaca College in Rancho San Diego, CA.

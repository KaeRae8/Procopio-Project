Inside THE US Grant, you can dine at the Grant Grill and imbibe at the Grant Lounge. THE US GRANT was built by Ulysses S. Grant, Jr., son of president Ulysses S. Grant, who named the hotel after his father. President Grant disapproved of the treatment of the Indians of the American West. In 1875, he passed an executive order setting aside 640 acres of land in Dahesa Valley in East San Diego County for the Kumeyaay Tribes. The hotel changed hands several times since the 1970s. In 2003, the hotel was purchased by the Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Tribe. Throughout the main lobby are exhibits that display traditional Kumeyaay culture such as basketry, traditional games, and home life.

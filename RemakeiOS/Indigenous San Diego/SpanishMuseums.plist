		<string>Located in San Diego&apos;s Mission Valley area, Mission San Diego de Alcala was bult in 1769 as the first Spanish mission in California. The Mission was only marginally successful in its attempts at converting the local Kumeyaay people. The Kumeyaay were so resistant to converting to Catholicism that not one conversion was recorded in the first year. This was in part because of food shortages at the mission, the inability to provide the Natives with promised clothing, the ability of the Kumeyaay to freely enter and exit the mission, but mainly due to the Kumeyaay&apos;s spirit of independence. In 1775, after strained relationships between Spanish soldiers, missionaries, and the Natives, several hundred Kumeyaay launched an attack on the Mission, destroying it by fire. The mission was rebuilt the following year in 1776. Initially, Missions were established by Spanish missionaries because the Spanish misunderstood Native culture and ways of life as uncivilized and felt the only way to civilize them was to convert them to Catholicism. Each Mission experience was different and changed through the years. Many missions in the beginning, enslaved the local indigenous peoples, while later, some missions were seen by the Natives as a peaceful place where they had access to community, food, and education. Today, many Native people continue to use the Missions as a place of worship and a notable place of history and culture, while others see the missions as a painful part of their history which contributed to the genocide of indigenous peoples. With respect to all viewpoints, the Spanish Missions played an important part of the Indigenous history of the San Diego region.

		<string>Located in Oceanside, CA, Mission San Luis Rey was founded in 1798. During this period, the missionaries imposed the name San Luiseno, or Luiseno, on the local Indigenous inhabitants of the land. The mission was more successful than the Mission San Diego de Alcala at converting the local Luiseno villages to Catholicism due to the agricultural success of the area and its ability to produce large quantity of foods for the Indigenous populations. Unfortunately, many Luiseno people suffered and died as a result of the European diseases, forced labor and loss of the way of life due to relocation and conversion to Catholicism. Luiseno people during this time were also forced into servitude, slavery or imprisonment for not complying with the Spanish Mission system.
